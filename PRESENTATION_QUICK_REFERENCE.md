# 🎤 Mini Interpreter - Presentation Quick Reference Card

## ⏱️ TIMING (Total: 15-20 minutes)

| Section | Time | Key Points |
|---------|------|------------|
| Introduction | 2-3 min | Hook, quick demo, overview |
| Architecture | 3-4 min | Pipeline diagram, explain stages |
| Live Demo | 8-10 min | 4 demos with explanations |
| Code Deep Dive | 3-4 min | Show file structure, key code |
| Q&A | 2-3 min | Prepared answers |

## 🎯 DEMO SEQUENCE

### Demo 1: Simple (2 min)
**Input:** `5 + 3`  
**Show:** All four stages  
**Result:** 8  
**Point:** Basic pipeline understanding

### Demo 2: Order of Operations (3 min)
**Input:** `2 + 3 * 4`  
**Show:** Parse tree structure  
**Result:** 14 (not 20!)  
**Point:** Tree structure enforces precedence

### Demo 3: Parsing Strategies (3 min)
**Input:** `(5 + 3) * 2`  
**Show:** Top-Down vs Bottom-Up  
**Result:** 16 (both ways)  
**Point:** Different algorithms, same result

### Demo 4: Complex (2 min)
**Input:** `10 - 4 / 2 + 3 * (2 + 1)`  
**Show:** Full evaluation steps  
**Result:** 17  
**Point:** System handles complexity

## 💡 KEY TALKING POINTS

### Tokenization
> "Converting text into meaningful chunks - like breaking a sentence into words"

### Parsing
> "Understanding the grammar and structure - like diagramming a sentence"

### Evaluation
> "Actually computing the result - like performing the mathematical operations"

### Parse Tree
> "The tree structure determines the order - deeper nodes are evaluated first"

### Two Strategies
> "Top-Down: intuitive, starts from expression. Bottom-Up: powerful, builds from tokens"

## ❓ QUICK ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Can it handle variables?**  
A: No, but great extension idea! Would need symbol table.

**Q: Why two parsers?**  
A: Educational - show different approaches to same problem.

**Q: Like real compilers?**  
A: Yes! Same pipeline. Real ones add: optimization, code gen, type checking.

**Q: What errors?**  
A: Syntax (grammar), runtime (division by zero), lexical (invalid chars).

**Q: Extensions?**  
A: Variables, functions, boolean logic, control flow.

## 🧪 BACKUP EXPRESSIONS (If Asked)

Simple:
- `7 - 2` → 5
- `3 * 8` → 24

Complex:
- `((10 + 5) / 3) * 2` → 10
- `100 / 5 / 2` → 10

Errors:
- `2 + * 3` → Syntax error
- `5 / 0` → Division by zero
- `2 + (3 * 4` → Missing parenthesis

## 🎨 PRESENTATION FLOW

1. **HOOK** (30 sec)
   - "Ever wonder how code is understood?"
   - Quick `2+3*4` demo → 14

2. **EXPLAIN** (3 min)
   - Draw pipeline on board
   - Explain each stage simply

3. **DEMONSTRATE** (10 min)
   - Follow demo sequence above
   - Ask predictive questions
   - Show errors

4. **DIVE DEEPER** (3 min)
   - Show file structure
   - Quick code walkthrough
   - Emphasize grammar rules

5. **CLOSE** (30 sec)
   - "All languages follow this pipeline"
   - "Thank you!"
   - Open for questions

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**If app crashes:**
- Use deployed version
- Show screenshots
- Explain from slides

**If question stumps you:**
- "Great question! Let me look into that"
- "I'd need to research that to give accurate answer"
- Be honest - it's okay!

**If running long:**
- Skip Demo 4
- Shorten code deep dive
- Go straight to Q&A

**If running short:**
- Do developer tools demo
- Show more error cases
- Discuss extensions in detail

## 🎯 MUST-COVER POINTS

✅ Tokenization breaks text into tokens  
✅ Parsing builds a tree structure (AST)  
✅ Tree structure enforces order of operations  
✅ Two parsing strategies demonstrate different approaches  
✅ Evaluation walks the tree to compute result  
✅ Error handling catches and reports problems
